# REZI

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/dekarrin/ictiobus.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dekarrin/ictiobus)

REZI is the Rarefied Encoding (Compressible) for Interop.

The REZI format is a binary format that was originally created for structs in
the [Ictiobus](github.com/dekarrin/ictiobus) project and eventually grew into
its own library for use with other projects.
